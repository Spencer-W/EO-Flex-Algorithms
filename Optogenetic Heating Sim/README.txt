Modified code by Spencer Ward that was originally written by Joseph M. Stujenske for Stujenske et al., "Modeling the spatiotemporal dynamics of light and heat propagation for in vivo optogenetics",
Cell Reports 12, 525 (2015).

Adjusted core size to match EO-Flex (3.8 microns), increased the simulation window resolution, adjusted the volume (decreased) of tissue that temperature was averaged over.
Resulting changes are found in the LightHeat_example.m

run31_ includes the optical pulse timing used in vivo with EO-Flex probes.
