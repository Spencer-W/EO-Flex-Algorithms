This folder contains some of the .m matlab scripts and .mat data files used to produce the figures found in "Electro-optical mechanically flexible coaxial microprobes for minimally invasive interfacing with intrinsic neural circuits".

After downloading this folder, open the .m script and add the path where it is located.
You can then run the program and it will generate the optical loss plots (measured and simulated data) and the electrical impedance plots for probes with and without PEDOT:PSS.
